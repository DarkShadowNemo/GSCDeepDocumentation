# GSCDeepDocumentation
all about deep documentation of gsc and even more depth into, not a code thing but it tells info

according to gsc they use lots of completed triangle strips than ghg, starting with a faceA, faceB, faceC and despite someone thinks nus are gsc which actually there not, gsc are gsc they uses a lot of triangle strips and inf and nan, if you test things out ingame they look like using dozens of remove lists, you can't get rid of faces there hardcoded you can only get rid of them on gamecube and xbox not ps2, according to gsc you can only get rid of the faces using vertex color alpha called 0x7f7f7f00, 0x7f7f7f00 and 0x7f7f7f00 that is how you can get rid of faces if the vertex colors are attached to the gsc triangle strips, using remove and append list can reconstruct and get everything entirely completed gsc which is coming very soon, you can make a 3d cube using triangle strips by removing disconnection and appending the verts to make a simple gsc mesh, more depth up soon
